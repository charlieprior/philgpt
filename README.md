# PhilGPT

I created this quick OpenAI Slackbot based on my advisor, Phil (with his permission). All code is provided as-is.

The "FineTuning" directory contains the code to generate the payload for the OpenAI fine-tuning API.

The "bot" directory contains the code for the Slackbot as deployed to AWS AppRunner.
